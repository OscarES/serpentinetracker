# Stewart's improvement note page

Emailed to Steve
  * Do at least a reasonable optimizer of lattice parameters
  * Put some simple diagnostics in. So my advanced BPM and some simple striplines etc 
  * ATL model for ground motion 
  * Wakefields. So some stuff on the effect of wake-fields. 
  * EPICS interface, so building a EPICS IOC from the serpentine model and then the control system coupled to the simulation
  * Feedback. Design some general feedback controllers that can be implemented 
  * Speed improvements etc (at least testing ideas)
  * Lattice visualisation

Ideas
  * Run control in serpentine (Track, TwissProp etc) 
  * VirtualMachine control class?
  * Girders, PowerSupplies?
  * Subbeamline and recursion. beamline should be element? 
  * Orbit structure unrelated to Diag....  
  * CalcRMat updates?

House keeping
  * Move all plotting to visualise
  * Start analysis class
